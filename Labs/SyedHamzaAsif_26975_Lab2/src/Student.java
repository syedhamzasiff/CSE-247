/*
Implement a Student class with variables like name, age and cgpa.
Also, implement interface comparable for the Student class which allows comparing two instances of the class based on cgpa.
Also, implement toString method for the Student class which returns the studentâ€™s name, age and cgpa as a String.
Next, create a list of students using the MyArrayList class implemented above.
Check if the find method of MyArrayList is working correctly.
For this, insert a student with 3.5 cgpa in the list and find it using the find method.

3. Add a findMax method in the MyArrayList class. It will find the student with the best cgpa.
